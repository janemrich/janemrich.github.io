![Pose Estimation](/assets/img/render_bboxes.jpg)

[Paper](https://github.com/janemrich/denstereo2/blob/denstereo/thesis.pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/janemrich/denstereo2)
- Leveraging stereo, we extend the state-of-the-art in the task of direct 6D pose regression.
- Created new real-world and synthetic data with blender simulation **BlenderProc** and Kinect cameras
- Preprocessed and cleaned data for use in a common format with **Numba**
- Implemented a end-to-end deep learning model with **PyTorch** on a GPU Cluster with **Slurm** and **Docker**

### Deep Unsupervised Denoising For Interleaved X-Ray Channels
![X-ray](/assets/img/x_ray.webp)
[Paper](/assets/pdf/Demosaicing_and_Denoising_For_Interleaved_X_Ray_Channels.pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/janemrich/cvlab)
- Trained deep neural nets for denoising in **PyTorch**
- Unsupervised, no ground truth data available
- Adaption of SOTA methods to the specific statistics of X-Ray images required understanding of the physics of the system
- Loss function had to fit the statistics of the noise generation process

### Multi-Object Tracking
- Tracked 3D poses of objects in **C++**
- Filtering with a particle filter over the probability distribution

### Genetic Algorithm for Build Order Optimization in StarCraft II (Bachelor Thesis)
[Repository](https://github.com/janemrich/BOoptimizer)
- wrote a genetic algorithm in **Java** to optimize game-playing
- parallel evaluation of build orders with a **C++** game bot

### Solar plus Battery EV charging park energy and cash flow simulator
[Repository](https://github.com/janemrich/ev-solar-park)
- Simulates a solar EV charging park in python with probability distributions
- Reports cash flows and balance sheet

### Electric Vehicle Comparison Website
[Repository](https://github.com/janemrich/eautoinfo.com) | [Website](https://eautoinfo.com/)
- wrote a EV Comparison Website in **React**
- self-hosted with **Docker** and **Virtual Root Server**
