- Leveraging stereo, we extend the state-of-the-art in the task of direct 6D pose regression.
- Created new real-world and synthetic data with blender simulation and Kincect cameras
- Implemented a end-to-end deep learning model with **PyTorch** on a

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
